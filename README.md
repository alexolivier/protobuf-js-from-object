# protobuf-js-from-object

This project comes from the issue: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/1591

There is no fromObject implementation in google-protobuf implementation so I wrote a little bit hacky solution to serialize protobuf object.

## Examples

To run example, run the following command in `examples` folder:

    yarn start
